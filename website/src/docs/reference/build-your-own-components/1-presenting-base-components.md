# Presenting Ocular's base components

Ocular comes out of the box with 12 components: 

- App,
- Footer,
- Header,
- Hero,
- Home, 
- InfoPanel,
- Input,
- Markdwon,
- Page,
- Search,
- Toc,
- Wrapper.

Each of them can be overwritten by your own implementation, by putting a component of the same name in /src/components/ from your ocular folder. For instance, you can make your own home page component by creating a Home.js component in your /src/components/ folder, and your ocular website will use it instead of the default version.
